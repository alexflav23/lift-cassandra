   * Client using the finagle-zookeeper integration and attempt to connect. If the initial ping is successful, we conclude a ZooKeeper is found. Otherwise,
   * we conclude it doesn't exist.
   *
   * At present times the Phantom connectors are not capable of monitoring for state change system wide, e.g a move from a local ZooKeeper to an embedded and
   * so on, therefore this check can be done a single time, as any major state change in the system with regards to ZooKeeper going down would not affect
   * existing Cassandra connections and any failure in a Cassandra node is handled by the Datastax driver.
